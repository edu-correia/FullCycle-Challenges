# Challenge #1 - Product Use Cases
### Chapter 10 - Clean Architecture

<br>

## :clipboard: Challenge:
Like it was presented on this module with the operations created for the Customer class, we should create the use cases classes alongside with the unit tests for each of the operations available for the Product class: "create", "list", "find" and "update".

<br>

## :bulb: Solution:
The solution was simple, I just had to study and understand what was done for the Customer class, like how the DTO's (Data transfer object) were being created and what should I really test and what should I mock the implementation.

## :arrow_forward: How to run it:
`npm run test`
